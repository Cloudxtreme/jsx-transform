# JSX in browser Transformer

This is the JSX transform in your browser code. React deprecated
this around the time of 0.14.x and pointed at Babel. Babel then
deprecated their in browser transform.

This also has Content-Security-Policy nonce support.

This code will no longer be updated once Cockpit no longer
needs it.
